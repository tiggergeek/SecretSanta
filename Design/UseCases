   that game.
3. The administrator invites other players to participate, either off-platform or using an email facility (phase 2).
4. Players register for the games, providing names, descriptions, guide prices and sources of each item, up to
   the number of choices set for each game. Players also provide a "don't buy for" player (eg spouse) for each game.
5. The admin checks registration progress by accessing a report of registered players and level of registration.
6. Once the admin (who may also be a player) is satisfied that all players have registered and completed their
   details, the game is run and players are given the name and choices of their "buy-for" player.
7. Players buy items and mark their game entry as complete.
